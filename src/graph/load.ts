/**
 * mtime-keyed in-process cache over the two readers `ask()` calls on every
 * query: the wiring graph (`readGraph`) and the ask sidecar (`readAskIndex`).
 * `graft ask` re-parses these from disk on every invocation; in a long-lived
 * process — the MCP server, or `graft ask` invoked repeatedly in one process —
 * that means re-parsing the same ~tens-of-MB JSON on every tool call.
 *
 * Keyed by `(path, mtimeMs, size)` from `statSync`, so a rebuild (`graft
 * build`) is picked up on the very next call with no polling and no TTL: the
 * stat is cheap relative to the parse it guards, and a changed mtime or size
 * invalidates the entry. A missing file returns null and is never cached — the
 * next call re-stats, so a file created after a prior miss is picked up
 * immediately (no negative caching).
 *
 * **Cache invalidation assumption:** This strategy assumes filesystem mtime
 * resolution is finer than build cadence. This is safe because `graft build`
 * rewrites the entire output file atomically, so same-size rewrites within a
 * single mtime tick (which would serve stale data) are infeasible in practice.
 * On APFS (macOS) mtime is nanosecond-granular and a build takes milliseconds,
 * so invalidation is immediate and reliable.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design: this module imports only `node:fs`, `./write.js`,
 * and `../ask/index-file.js`, so it can be imported from both `ask.ts` and
 * `mcp/tools.ts` without creating an import cycle.
